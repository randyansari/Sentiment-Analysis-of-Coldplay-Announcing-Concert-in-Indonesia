# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Coldplay-Announcing-Concert-in-Indonesia

On May 9, 2023, one of the most popular British bands in the world, Coldplay, announced that they will hold a concert in Jakarta, Indonesia. The announcement was welcomed with great fanfare by their Indonesian fans as this was the first time they had held a concert in the archipelago. Therefore, I am interested in conducting a sentiment analysis of Indonesians to see how Indonesians respond to this announcement. Here I extracted data from Twitter to get data on Indonesians' Tweets related to Coldplay. Then I conducted sentiment analysis using the BERT method.
